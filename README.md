# calculator

This project is a part of The Odin Project cirriculum. 
It is an attempted clone of the iOS native calculator app. I tried to reverse-engineer as much of the functionality of the iOS app as I could.
I deviated a bit from TOP's specified requirements by making my calculator follow the mathemetical order of operations.
